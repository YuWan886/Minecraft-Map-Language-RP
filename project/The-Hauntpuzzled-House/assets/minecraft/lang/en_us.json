  "storyteller.house.storyteller_name":"Storyteller",
  "storyteller.house.1_beginning":"One day Eriot the Scientist received a strange invitation to the abandoned house located far outside the city. Why would anyone call from there? Interested, Eriot arrived at the mysterious house in his truck.",
  "storyteller.house.2_entrance":"After passing through the gate, Eriot heard that it slam shut behind him! When Eriot needs to go back, he'll have to look for another way... Seeing someone at the entrance, the scientist went to the door of this house.",
  "storyteller.house.3_first_door":"Finding the only open door, Eriot went to the most damaged side of the house. The strange ghostly villager seems to want to take him somewhere...",
  "storyteller.house.4_puzzle_doors":"Who knows why there are door puzzles in this house... Lost in thought, Eriot dropped his bow and arrow, and they fell deep through the gap between the planks.",
  "storyteller.house.5_grave_trap":"The scientist fell into the grave to inspect the chest, but it turned out to be a trap.",
  "storyteller.house.6_ghost_attack":"Eriot the Scientist was not afraid of ghosts. But he didn't expect such an unexpected attack! Had the ghostly villager lured him into a trap?",
  "storyteller.house.7_first_new_tool":"No, it's clear that the one who leads him also did not expect an assault! Having received a new axe, Eriot figured out that it is needed to open a hidden passage behind the bookshelves!",
  "storyteller.house.8_pumpkin_pattern_room":"Another puzzle room! These pumpkins on the wall indicate some combinations... The scientist guessed that only one of them would open the door and began to push the slimes onto the pressure plates.",
  "storyteller.house.9_lever_room_doors":"Eriot went through many corridors, climbing in and out of windows. When the door opened, the scientist was disappointed to find that the door leads to the corridor where he already was. Actually, that lever opened not only this door, but another nearby.",
  "storyteller.house.10_blindness_room_levers":"Apparently, due to the strange ghosts, one room was cursed. Eriot the Scientist didn't know how to get out, but in fact, he only needed to find 3 levers there to open the exit doors.",
  "storyteller.house.11_cold_above":"When Eriot walked out of the cursed room to the staircase, he felt a chill coming from above. The ghostly villager led him there...",
  "storyteller.house.12_tp_chair_room":"Eriot believed that the ice nearby appeared because of the ghosts. Apparently, this strange chair somehow attracted them. It seemed that its pressure plate was missing... However, the scientist should not be worried about this right now. Another machine in this room was hiding something important inside.",
  "storyteller.house.12_2_ice_pickaxe":"A pickaxe against the ice... The ghostly villager seemed to want to take Eriot to the main stairs again to break the ice there... Where it is leading the scientist?",
  "storyteller.house.13_redstone_pistons_room":"Eriot saw a very strange way to block a door.",
  "storyteller.house.14_burning_room":"Then Eriot wondered, is what the ghostly villager wants to show worth such problems? A burning room was especially dangerous. But since he had already walked around most of the house, he should not give up the search.",
  "storyteller.house.15_mossy_dungeon_room":"Here it is, the source of the ghosts! Oh, wait, it turned out to be squids. It seems even the ghostly villager did not know where they came from...",
  "storyteller.house.16_attic_pistons":"The house was full of strange primitive mechanisms as if someone wanted to make it difficult to move around the house... Those pistons near the windows had to be turned on in order to climb higher.",
  "storyteller.house.17_Blacklite":"There was someone alive in the house! The strange inhabitant looked gloomily at the scientist, not wanting to talk to him. Nothing seems to surprise him...",
  "storyteller.house.18_nitron_diary":"It seems that there was some hint in this message... The scientist has to dig out and check...",
  "storyteller.house.19_revelation_room":"So it was Nort Nitron! He invited Eriot to this house, but, unfortunately, died. Eriot the Scientist saw the messages on the wall and discovered the terrible truth! Now he had to help, otherwise, the watermelon ghosts would haunt him.",
  "storyteller.house.20_ghost_trap_room":"Whoa! Nitron has foreseen everything! After reading the note, Eriot got out of the room using all his acquired tools and went to the golden hatch to the basement.",
  "storyteller.house.21_broken_cellar_machine":"Careless scientist blew up the machine! Fortunately, Nitron wrote what to do in this case.",
  "storyteller.house.22_unusable_machine":"This machine was too complicated for Eriot, how to turn off the antenna was not clear... After thinking a little and deciding to manually break the antenna, the scientist climbed to the roof.",
  "storyteller.house.23_ghost_maze":"After broken the antenna and falling below the roof, Eriot the Scientist found himself in the even more abandoned attic. Hearing the terrible sounds, the scientist Eriot realized that this is the main hideout of the watermelon ghosts! Luckily he had a powerful diamond axe to defend himself!",
  "storyteller.house.24_final_machine":"The scientist escaped from the ghosts attic by falling into a gap and landed in the basement, next to the prototype of another anti-ghost machine! Since destroying the antenna didn't seem to work, the dangerous and unstable machine was the last chance for Eriot! He had to take the risk!",
  "storyteller.house.25_final_run":"Eriot had one and a half minutes to get to the truck and leave to not die! Since the main gate has locked, the scientist was forced to find the place where he can jump over the fence!",
  "storyteller.house.26_after_the_events":"After these events, the house was restored and populated by new residents, who arrived on their own, not knowing what had happened. Due to the destruction of all ghosts here, people have lost their fear of this place.\n\n Many years passed, Eriot built his own machine to get rid of the ghosts left outside the house, but this time nothing worked. Poor Eriot the Scientist exploded, leaving countless watermelon ghosts around the world intact...\n\n Until one day people learned the terrible truth about their favourite delicious fruits and took decisive action! But that is a completely different story...",
  "storyteller.house.bonus_level_1":"A few days before Eriot's visit to this house, terrible events happened. Watermelon ghost suspicions were confirmed when Nitron tested his machine.\n When Nitron was writing his book, ghosts suddenly attacked him, forcing him to flee. However, climbing into his secret shelter under the stage in a hurry, Nort did not notice that one ghost had seen him and was about to head after.",
  "storyteller.house.bonus_level_2":"Nitron doesn't want to give up! To kill him, the ghost will have to find a way across the slime and not be destroyed by the slime cannon!",
  "storyteller.house.bonus_level_3":"Nort Nitron did not manage to escape and was killed. He was buried by the last habitant of the house, Blacklite, and it seemed that now no one would stop the watermelon ghosts, but... A few hours earlier, Nitron had sent an invitation to his friend, Eriot the Scientist. And then... you know everything already!",
