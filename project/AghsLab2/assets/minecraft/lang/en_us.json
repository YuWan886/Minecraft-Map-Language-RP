Leaving poor Aghanim no other choice, but to quietly end their lives and reabsorb from their bodies my own power. Eh, you know, I feel like this should've been obvious to you from the get-go.

  "block.command_block.664.command.2": "Let me tell you what a continuum device is. Capable of bending space and time the continuum device yields unto its owner unlimited power to shape infinite realities. That's from the owner's manual. Uh, ships with an exclusive nylon drawstring pouch, a piece unique, one of one. Pouch machine washable. Device does not immediately destroy the universe. That's from the box.",
  "block.command_block.665.command.2": "Good work, everybody! You should all be very proud of yourselves! I know I'm proud of myself. I did a lot of work to make this happen. So, be proud of whatever it was you were also doing to make this happen.",
  "block.command_block.666.command.2": "Oh, crap! It's the primal beast I was telling you about. Alright, *clears throat* nothing to worry about. Uh, he's honestly only got the one trick he does. It's, I mean, it is one hundred percent effective. He is going to kill you, probably, but, well, let's get some hustle down there. Go team!",
  "block.command_block.667.command.2": "Now, at first I felt a bit guilty, I'll admit. Sending you into the continuum vault to clean up my mess, but it looks like you heroes are having a heap of fun. I only mention it, because beyond this door.. I'm pretty sure the fun is going to end. But, remember the fun.",

  "block.command_block.677.command.2": "Oh! Get out of the way!",
  "block.command_block.680.command.2": "Oh! Heads up!",
  "block.command_block.681.command.2": "Look out!",
  "block.command_block.682.command.2": "I, uh, kept it a secret what I was doing to the alternate universe mes, because I knew you'd be devastated. Just the idea of killing an Aghanim. Oh, it's a tragedy. One Aghanim is like a 100,000 regular people, so slurping their brain energy out of their skulls, it isn't something I do lightly.",
  "block.command_block.683.command.2": "Oh, uhh, hm, not trying to alarm you here. Don't panic, but using the continuum device might - I want to stress might - have awakened a primal force of ancient evil. So, just, uh, heads up on that. If you see one, that's-that's what it is.",
  "block.command_block.684.command.2": "I mean, there is a lot of helpful stuff in this owner's manual: \"How to turn the continuum device on\", \"How to alter space time properly\", \"How to avoid filling your reality with inferior versions of yourself from backwater alternate dimensions\". Huh. Kind of wish I'd read this thing before I started pushing all the buttons. Ha. Hm.",
  "block.command_block.685.command.2": "Looking through the troubleshooting section of the continuum device manual I'm hoping I can just reboot the thing. Aaaannnd there! Did, uh, did reality just, uh, start and restart? Did anyones hair turn white and they can't stop screaming? If someones white-haired and screaming, that's good. That means it worked!",
  "block.command_block.686.command.2": "Hold on, hold on. I'm-I'm on hold with customer service. Uh-eh, what's that? Yes, you idiot! Of course I pressed the green button. Uh, hm. Uh-uh, exactly! Of course I didn't press the green button, that's what I said. That-that would've released countless interdimensional versions of me into the space-time continuum and voided the warranty. So, that's why I didn't press the green button, because I read the manual!",
  "block.command_block.687.command.2": "I'm still on hold with customer serv-. Hang on. What's that? No, I have some heroes in there now, I can't get them out the-. Well, of course it's deadly, that's why I chose heroes, I-. What's that? Really? Uh-huh. Oh. Oh, you're-you're kidding? Oh god.",
  "block.command_block.688.command.2": "You might be wondering what I'm doing with all of these Aghanims after you rescue them. Well, I'll tell you. They're all going to a wizard farm; up north. They're frolicking and eating lettuce. It's-it's-it's nice.",
  "block.command_block.689.command.2": "Alright, alright. You deserve to know the truth. The alternate universe Aghanims you're rescuing... I'm killing them. Re-absorbing their energy. Out of their eye sockets. Excruciatingly painful, they're dessicated husks when I'm done. I do sell the husks to a wizard farm up north, that part I wasn't lying about. They make pig slurry out of them.",
  "block.command_block.690.command.2": "Huzzah! You killed.. well, chased off and gravely embarassed the primal beast. But now comes the bittersweet breaking of our fellowship. Aghanim the wizard, you the-the guy, the sword guy, the rest of you. Look, Aghanim had a lot of plates spinning magically in the aether and didn't have time to learn everyones names, okay?",
  "block.command_block.691.command.2": "Oh, I did it! I feel so much better! I surge with power! My robes flow with wonder! I can hang up on tech support who has had me on hold for over 600 hours. Oh, until we meet again heroes!",
  "block.command_block.692.command.2": "Wah, you've done it! I can-, I'm shocked! I didn't expect this! You know what, I am just going to read you the speech I prepared for you when you all died at the cusp of an impossible victory. *clears throat* Lo, these mere mortals, these courageous heroes all died doing what they loved. Looking at someone they loved. Me, Aghanim the All-loveable looking down upon them as they die. The last words on their lips were \"Glad you survived Aghanim, you were the best of us. You..\". Well, goes on from there, but that's the part where you all sound good. Anyway, my sincerest thanks!",
  "block.command_block.693.command.2": "Alas, there is one last order of business.",
  "block.command_block.694.command.2": "Now where is that awful copy of me?",
  "block.command_block.695.command.2": "But more importantly, my powers.",
  "block.command_block.696.command.2": "Wait, wait! Lest we forget why we're all here.",
  "block.command_block.697.command.2": "The heroes return! Yes, the continuum vault holds yet more bargain basement spellbinders. Pursue these Aghanims with zeal, despite the vile monsters before you being stronger, and faster, aaand with more hit points.",
  "block.command_block.698.command.2": "You've returned! The continuum vault holds much darker secrets now. Secrets so murky, so wretched that Aghanim's sister-in-law would certainly divulge each one half way through her first glass of boxed wine at the Aghanim family holidays. Ooh, is Sheila in there? Huh, make haste and find out!",
  "block.command_block.699.command.2": "Bless the astral plane, you've decided to aid your wizard friend one last time! Let Aghanim be frank: I, *clears throat* I would have been utterly screwed if it weren't for all of you. I need.. Aghanim actually does really need you. There is but one alternate reality Aghanim left. Believe me when I tell you it pains me to say this. I mean it, it-it really hurts. Like, look at you.. and then look at me. Right? Look back at you and look back at me. Just do it! As quickly as possible! Back, forth. Back, forth. Back, forth. You see what I mean?",
  "block.command_block.700.command.2": "So you think you put your lives on the line for old Aghanim and get something in return? Something as priceless as my gratitude? Well, that is exactly what you get. I truly do appreciate you.",
  "block.command_block.701.command.2": "Sensational! You've returned to help Aghanim the conjurer of chaos. I'm feeling weak, my heroes. Today I could barely conjure some clutter chaos, huh, it's out of the question.",
  "block.command_block.702.command.2": "Oh, my gracious heroes! The continuum vault remains riddled with subpar Aghanims. They await your rescue! But be warned: before you is the same snarl of monsters, goblins and beasts that bested you before.",
  "block.command_block.703.command.2": "Oh, thank goodness you're here. Aghanim's powers continue to wane. Please, rescue these magical doppelgangers whose very duplicate existence drains Aghanim's marvelousness away. Return them to me one by one and I will bend over backwards, making sure the dear, dear hearts get home safely. Aghanim doesn't hold grudges against these bloodsucking parasites.",
  "block.command_block.704.command.2": "The heroes return! Let us waste no time on pleasantries. Get in there and find me an Aghanim. Their very existence drains me of my power. Without my power I'm just a man in a ridiculous purple robe, with stars on it and a blue moon right there.",
  "block.command_block.705.command.2": "Perhaps this time Aghanim the Wise will institute a new rule; here it is: no dying. At least until you rescue whatever messed up Aghanim is trapped inside the continuum vault; then you can die whenever you feel like it.",
  "block.command_block.706.command.2": "A, uh, foursome of total losers just entered the continuum vault and were immediately slain. So, get in there and fight for Aghanim while the monsters are tired from the skirmish.",
  "block.command_block.707.command.2": "Good news! You've decided to help me in my quest to eradicate this reality of duplicate Aghanims. But, also, and you may not realize this: by making your way through the continuum vault you're participating in a top-notch weight loss exercise. I mean, do you know how much your blood weighs? It's a lot!",
  "block.command_block.708.command.2": "Oh, no, there he is. Okay, on the plus side, I knew he was going to be here. I was sure of it. And also on the plus side, I didn't tell you I was sure of it, because I didn't want to stress you all out. So, no downsides from Aghanim, ha. And-and also, how often do you get to fight one of the most ruthless beings ever known. What I'm saying to you is, it's all upside. You're lucky, actually, when you think of it.",
  "block.command_block.709.command.2": "Oh, crap. It's the primal force of ancient evil, the primal beast I was telling you about. Alright, alright, don't panic. Honestly, he's only got like one move. It's super basic! Easily avoidable.. and one hundred percent effective, unfortunately.",
  "block.command_block.710.command.2": "Okay, this time, you'll probably kill the primal beast, and even if you don't, look on the bright side: I'll still be alive. I'm very safe here!",
  "block.command_block.711.command.2": "Now, heroes, all you have to do is fight your way through one - just one - primal force of ancient evil and you'll have helped dear Aghanim in his quest. One! That's half of two! God, there better not be two. No, no no no, there's no way there is two. They'd have killed everything in existence by now, if there were two.",
  "block.command_block.712.command.2": "Okay, we can do this! Let's focus. Focus is number one. Don't look it in the eyes. That's two. Don't turn your back on him. Don't run. Eh, turn your back on him if you have to and-and just act casual. You know, be cool.",
  "block.command_block.713.command.2": "Remember, one man's trash is another man's overpriced mistake.",
  "block.command_block.714.command.2": "No bad choices here! Wait... no bad choices here.",
  "block.command_block.715.command.2": "Ooh, see what's being offered and then take it immediately. That's my motto!",
  "block.command_block.716.command.2": "Look! A small business owner!",
  "block.command_block.717.command.2": "Before you go in, remember this villain is not your friend. Sure, does he look friendly? Does he make you want to say \"Hey, haven't we met somewhere before?\" Sure! But, listen hero, do not say that! I need you to go in there and start firing spells, start stabbing, whatever you've got. Do not let the continuum vault corrupt your mind!",
  "block.command_block.718.command.2": "Be warned, I have fought this vile conjurer before. Well, I-I've imagined fighting him before. I imagine fighting everyone the moment I meet them and then I rank them in a long list of who would be the easiest to fight. Now, Lindsey, she's the child that walks Aghanim's dog. Lindsey is at the bottom of the list, but this boss is definitely somewhere near the top.",
  "block.command_block.719.command.2": "Okay, okay, listen, now you have killed a bunch of monsters, a whole heap of creeps. Now, good news: I think there's only one thing to kill in this room. Eh, bad news: he's about a million times stronger than those wimps you just annihilated.",
  "block.command_block.720.command.2": "Be careful now. Don't take unnecessary risks, only necessary risks. Like, risk your life to kill this boss if you have to, but don't make me have to do anything. That kind of thing.",
  "block.command_block.721.command.2": "This one looks serious. I don't think it's guarding anything. I'm not even sure if it works here. This one wants to fight. Look at it, it's got crazy eyes.",
  "block.command_block.722.command.2": "I give you even odds on this one. Eh, probably it will kill you, but, eh, maybe not. Let's see how it moves.",
  "block.command_block.723.command.2": "Now, remember this monster is probably more scared of you than you are of it. U-unless that's bees or bears? I think.. wait, no, uh, I remember now. It's definitely not bees, so if you see a hive run. Those things are fearless.",
  "block.command_block.724.command.2": "Worry not, for as long as one of you still lives the pure, good light of the true and stalwart hero wil-.. are you all dead? You're kidding me.",
  "block.command_block.725.command.2": "Oh, don't worry, we're not dead yet! Put some hustle in it and th-.. what's that? Oh, you are all dead. Okay, forget what I said about the hustle, not-not gonna need that, heh.",
  "block.command_block.726.command.2": "What a fun twist of fate for us all! Last time Aghanim helped you become stronger, wiser heroes by murdering you over and over again and this go-around you're helping Aghanim become stronger and wiser by being murdered over and over again.",
  "block.command_block.727.command.2": "Urgh, gosh, really needed you guys to come through for me here. Guess my only option is to learn to live with being mediocre at best. Yo, maybe I'll get into the guitar, pick up some gigs at a farmer's market, nothing serious. Yeah, uhh, that sounds okay.",
  "block.command_block.728.command.2": "Alright, you're all dead! No big deal, I've got another batch of heroes here, so I'll tell them about all the ways you failed here, so that they don't do the same. See, chin up! No, would someone actually please pick up this guys severed chin off of the ground, it's super gross.",
  "block.command_block.729.command.2": "Aghanim put to much pressure on you, didn't he? Ugh, this always happens. I meet a nice bunch of heroes, we move a little fast, we're getting along like a house on fire. I get my hopes up and then.. nothing! No warning, no call, not even a text! And I'll sit around all day thinking \"Eh, maybe their mom is sick\" or \"Maybe they all died in a reality-bending dungeon\". I don't think you realize just how cruel that is.",
  "block.command_block.730.command.2": "Okay, so you're all dead. Heh, this continuum vault is a real meat grinder, huh? Hm, does the continuum device grind meat? Is that in the manual? Let me see. Ehhh, you know it makes no sense they put these things in so many languages. How do you say meat grinder in french? Ah, here it is. Hachoir à viande. Heh, nice, nice.",
  "block.command_block.731.command.2": "You're all dead? I thought you were heroes. How did you get into hero school anyway? Were your parents alumni or something? Did you even graduate?",
  "block.command_block.732.command.2": "Wait, you're all dead? You're kidding me? I barely took my eyes off of you for a minute. How is that even possible? Did you all have a simultaneous heart attack or something?",
  "block.sign.1221.front_text3.1": "Part 3",
  "block.sign.1222.front_text1.1": "\"Random\"",
  "block.command_block.734.command.2": "Watch out!",
  "block.command_block.735.command.2": "Heads up!",
  "block.command_block.741.command.2": "Now before you go and get all judgy about Aghanim the All-powerful attempting to eke out a little more power by mucking around with the continuum device, remember that in modern society and all of its charms, was brought to you by someone trying to eke out just a little more power. Capitalism makes hypocrites of us all.",
  "block.command_block.742.command.2": "Now, according to the manual: \"What have been wrought, once wrought, cannot be unwrought.\" Huh. Possible I haven't gotten to the troubleshooting part of the manual yet. I'll tell you what, I'll keep reading the manual and why don't you heroes make yourselves useful and go round up all the other parallel universe mes. Meet you back here.",
  "block.command_block.743.command.2": "Well, they put a lot of fancy promotional language on the continuum device packaging. What it doesn't say is what's inside is as fragile as a hummingbird's egg. So, in a rush to get it out of the box and start altering space and time, if you happen to press any of its myriad buttons just a little bit too hard, it's going to go haywire and start filling your reality with inferior versions of yourself from far-flung universes. Each of which diminishes your power exponentially simply by existing. Is that a lot of copy for a modest amount of packaging? Yes! Does it also sound pretty important? Also, yes!",
  "block.command_block.744.command.2": "We - you and I - have a relationship built on trust. So, you need to trust, that when we rescue one of these Aghanims I am going to try to get them back to their home reality. I'm going to try really hard. And you have to trust that I have. I'm trusting you to trust me. It's the trust that's key. Not so much, where they actually end up, the guys, but the trust.",
  "block.command_block.749.command.2": "Ugh, look at this one. Real pick of the alternate reality litter we have here. Let's go, this way. Away.",
  "block.command_block.750.command.2": "Oh, look, the most powerful wizard from a barnyard reality. Well, he'll be thrilled with where he's going.",
  "block.command_block.751.command.2": "Look at him, full of prime Aghanim power. Phew-hu, Aghanims, can't live with them, can't just kill them and reabsorb your power!",
  "block.command_block.752.command.2": "Oh, hey, look at this little fella. Whatever he wants, just give it to him.",
  "block.command_block.753.command.2": "Well, you're probably wondering if that unkillable primal beast is still prowling the depths of the continuum vault; hungry only for flesh and bone. I mean, that's what I would be wondering about, if I were in your shoes. Hah.",
  "block.command_block.754.command.2": "Oh-o-o-o, just got handwritten word here, that primal beast, the ancient evil one.. gone! Oh, wait there's a little more on the backside.. gone absolutely insane. Oh.",
  "block.command_block.755.command.2": "Remember, heroes, the primal force of ancient evil still lurks in the continuum vault. I don't think there's any chance you've forgotten that, I just, I like saying \"primal force of ancient evil\". Feels good.",
  "block.command_block.756.command.2": "You know, I was thinking, really glad to have you for helping me out here, but it.. might have been just quicker for me to have recruited the primal beast himself. I mean, he seems super good at killing stuff and might just hand over the Aghanims, once we, you know, build a rapport. Oh, well, it's just the way it goes.",
  "block.command_block.757.command.2": "What if, instead of fighting the primal beast and immediately dying, you guys asked him to join your crew, you know? Ah, I bet, he never even gets asked.",
  "block.command_block.758.command.2": "Treasure for the stalwart.",
  "block.command_block.759.command.2": "You all have earned yourselves a little treasure!",
  "block.command_block.760.command.2": "I wonder what they're offering.",
  "block.command_block.761.command.2": "It's someone you don't have to kill. That's new and fun.",
  "block.command_block.762.command.2": "Now, there's nothing that he can offer you that I can't. Uhh, no, uhh, heh, actually there is no way I can do any of that.",
  "block.command_block.763.command.2": "Ooh, yeah, get some of this stuff.",
  "block.command_block.764.command.2": "Look, I know, you don't want to take money advice from Aghanim, but I feel like you should put at least some of that gold into a high-yield savings or managed account.",
  "block.command_block.765.command.2": "What are you buying? Can you buy two?",
  "block.command_block.766.command.2": "You can afford that? How much am I paying you?",
  "block.command_block.767.command.2": "Remember, money can buy happiness. It absolutely, one hundred percent can buy you happiness. Anyone who says otherwise, psh, lying.",
  "block.command_block.768.command.2": "That boss was so much bigger than you, but you killed it anyway. My goodness! Huh. You know maybe it had some sort of microphobia and it was just terrified of you from the start. Sort of sad, actually, this hulking beast terrified, fighting for its life. Tss, oh well.",
  "block.command_block.769.command.2": "Great work! But don't relish it for too long, remember you're only as great as the last magnificent being that you've killed.",
  "block.command_block.770.command.2": "Ho-ho-ho, yes! What's my name? What is my name? And you guys did good too.",
  "block.command_block.771.command.2": "We make a great team! Your brawn and my brains, and my strategy, and my communication and my patience and my interpersonal skills. Most of the heavy lifting on my end. 80-20-ish, but go team!",
  "block.command_block.772.command.2": "Good work! By me! Being smart enough to bet big on you winning. Uh, you were a heavy underdog at the dark elf casino. You know, a certain mighty sorcerer, named Aghanim, might be buying a new pool this year.",
  "block.command_block.773.command.2": "Nice work down there! Good killing! Very brutal and efficient. Honestly, if-if I was in the room with you right now I'd be frightened. You're terrifyingly precise at murder!",
  "block.command_block.774.command.2": "Okay, your're all dead. Aghanim should have prepared himself for this eventuality, emotionally speaking. While this is a primal force of ancient evil after all, that's on me.",
  "block.command_block.775.command.2": "Oh, we were so close. Ugh, Aghanim's power is waning. Feel the emptiness growing. I really needed this and I understand that laying a guilt trip on a pile of dead bodies is pointless, but, ugh, really thought we were gonna get this done today, you know.",
  "block.command_block.776.command.2": "I wasn't paying attention. Did you win? Ooh, what happened? Oh boy.",
