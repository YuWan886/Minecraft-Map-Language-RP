    "dialogue.Dustin3.5": "[Dustin] Huh?  Oh that there is the gate back into the downtown district of Solar City.  You probably shouldn't be runnin' off there - Admiral Keyes would get super mad if one of us deserted before the mission even began!",
    "dialogue.Dustin4.1": "] Recruit!  Are you a freaking ghost or something!?  Or is that really you and you somehow survived!  I swear partner, we couldn't find anything left of you in the wreckage...  It has been one wild ride since then.  Can you believe this place?  It's like some safe haven from all the cursed farting monsters out there!  Anyways, I'm sure as heavens glad to see you're doing okay partner.",
    "dialogue.Dustin4.2": "> How did you get here?",
    "dialogue.Dustin4.3": "[Dustin] Well...  Long story short, we got attacked by a band of freaks that barfed, exploded...  and farted!  I...  Ran as fast as I could and somehow found a portal leading here.  The others weren't so lucky...",

    "dialogue.Dustin5.2": "> So...  about the airship attack.  What happened back there?",
    "dialogue.Dustin5.3": "[Dustin] Well sheesh, I'm not sure myself.  I was fast asleep down on the lou when all the sudden that dragon riding fellow started flame-broiling the ship.  What do you think his deal was, anyways?",
    "dialogue.Dustin5.4": "> Uh, why do I need to give you emeralds?",
    "dialogue.Dustin5.5": "[Dustin] Err sorry friend but I gotta earn a living out here.  My son wants to go to fancy-pants college and I sorta promised him the treasure I bring home would fund it...  You can share some of the loot you find, right?",
    "dialogue.Dustin6.1": "] Oh... hey recruit.  Don't mind me, I'm just hanging out here.  Let me know if you need supplies.  I know it doesn't make up for us leaving you to die back there but I'm trying my best...",
    "dialogue.Dustin6.2": "> Yeah, supplies... that I have to pay for?",
    "dialogue.Dustin6.3": "[Dustin] Yeah...  What can I say, if we ever make it back to Solar City, I gotta provide for my family.  Sorry...",
    "dialogue.Dustin6.4": "> Yeah you're a real help you useless idiot.",
    "dialogue.Dustin7.1": "] ...Ya know, it really just aint the same without Eddie here.  I know that guy could be something of a Jackass sometimes but he really brought some energy to this crew.",
    "dialogue.Dustin7.2": "> Wait, where is he?",
    "dialogue.Dustin7.3": "[Dustin] Aww jeez, I thought you would know by now?  Did you miss him somewhere?  I think he managed to escape with the others when we were originally attacked by The Slaughterer and his men.",
    "dialogue.Dustin8.1": "] Recruit!  Eddie's been telling me how you took down a massive burning Ogre!  That's crazy!  You really doing it big out there - almost like you're straight out of one of those Sun Guardian picture books I seen as a kid.",
    "dialogue.Dustin8.2": "> Who's the Sun Guardian?",
    "dialogue.Dustin8.3": "[Dustin] Eh, it's just some mythical story from the old days about some crazy hero that restores the Sun when it disappears.  But it don't make no sense - I mean, the Sun is like a giant ball of burning fire, it aint going nowhere.",
    "dialogue.Dustin8.4": "> That's right!  I'm the Sun Guardian!",
    "dialogue.Dustin8.5": "[Dustin] Huh, oh yeah and I'm Santa Claus!  Ha!  Great to see you still have yer sense of humour after all that's happened, recruit.",

    "dialogue.Dustin9.3": "[Dustin] Oh, uh, dang recruit I'm mighty sorry to hear that...  Man, I sure wish I could do more than just sit here in this pot.  But you've proven you're the strongest of us all I think.",
    "dialogue.Dustin9.4": "> Why are you sitting in that cauldron?",
    "dialogue.Dustin9.5": "[Dustin] I dunno recruit...  I think I got some issues. I've only ever felt safe in life when sitting in an iron cauldron, even if it's a toilet.",

    "dialogue.Dustin10.1": "] Well hey there, Captain!  I gotta say, I really don't think any of us would have guessed you'd save the entire crew and pretty much the whole world when you joined us as a fresh recruit.  But I'm glad you did!  You're one inspiring hero, partner.",
    "dialogue.Dustin10.2": "> Aren't you going to miss this place?",
    "dialogue.Dustin10.3": "[Dustin] Well...  Truth be told, I think I'll miss these simple days, living on this barren rock, sitting in a cauldron, hanging out with the rest of this here crew.  We made the best of a bad situation...",

    "dialogue.Dustin13.2": "!?  Look, I know I'm not as courageous as you are but not everyone is destined to be the hero in life...  Some of us are just, well, background characters...",

    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes1.3": "[Admiral Keyes] What?  Recruit I don't have the faintest idea what this man is asking!  Please...  Just dig deep for the answers.  Otherwise answer option C.",

    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes2.1": "] Glad to see you could join us, captain!  We figured after all that the crew has been through recently that it was time to park the airship and take in the sights.  From the bottom of my heart, captain, I'm glad everything turned out okay.  You turned out to be the greatest new recruit we could have asked for!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes2.2": "> Thanks Admiral!  On to the next adventure...",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes2.3": "[Admiral Keyes] Lead the way, captain!  You have the most loyal crew at your back.  The open sky is there for the exploring!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes3.1": "] Recruit!  I...  I can't believe it!  You're alive!?  How on earth did you survive the airship crash?  I swear I saw you burn to ash in front of me!  But even crazier is you being here, in the God King's realm!  Are you real or is this all just some dream?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes3.2": "> Nope, I'm real.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes4.1": "] You know recruit...  I have this distinct feeling that the God King is watching us, even now.  There's no way we could have traveled all this way just to not find him, right?",

    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes4.3": "> What is this place?",

    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes5.1": "] Well, recruit, you don't know how relieved I am to know you're okay.  But this place...  I originally ventured here to meet this so called God King but he has yet to show himself.  In fact, I haven't seen a soul since first traveling through the portal.  Then there's these strange structures...  Recruit, I'm afraid to say we're stuck here with no way back.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes5.2": "> How did you wind up here?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes5.3": "> What is this place?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes5.4": "> What do you mean by \"strange structures\"?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes6.1": "] It's quite a long story, recruit.  After that dragon arrived, the remnants of the crew and I emerged from the airship wreckage, unharmed for the most part.  Faced with no other option, we ventured forth in search of whatever we could find.  From there, it was one disaster after another.  After being outcast and ambushed on all sides from terrifying monsters...  I resolved to find this God King and ask him for his aid.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes6.2": "> Why did you leave me behind?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes6.3": "[Admiral Keyes] Like I said, recruit - myself and others in the crew could have sworn that we saw you burst into flames during the attack.  We couldn't find any trace of you in the wreckage...  Perhaps we should have looked harder.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes6.4": "> ...and you thought finding the God King was a good plan?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes6.5": "[Admiral Keyes] It still waits to be seen whether it was a good plan or not.  When I heard of this mysterious man able to control the very fabric of reality, the explorer in me had to see if this was real.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes6.6": "> But how did you get here without the Divine Relics?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes6.7": "[Admiral Keyes] Divine Relics?  I'm sorry, recruit, I don't know what you're referring to.  I traveled to the God King's sanctuary and jumped into the portal - there was nothing preventing me from getting here.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes7.1": "] Well...  Beyond this being a creation of this mysterious God King figure, I have no earthly idea.  Everything here looks so strange.  Even the color of the grass, trees, and clouds all feel...  otherworldly somehow.  Like from a time long past...",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes7.2": "> Did you build this house?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes7.3": "[Admiral Keyes] Believe it or not - no.  This camp and house were here when I initially arrived.  I've been able to survive here off the food and farm in camp.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes7.4": "> Where is the God King?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes7.5": "[Admiral Keyes] I don't know, recruit.  It's a bit anticlimactic, eh?  To travel all this way in hopes of finding this divine man...  Only to be alone in this place, with no way to escape.  But there has to be some way of getting back...",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes7.6": "> Is there anything else on this island?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes7.7": "[Admiral Keyes] As far as I can tell...  There's nothing.  Not even any monsters to speak of until I came across one of the most terrifying beasts I'd ever seen...  A massive giant that was capable of chucking exploding sheep!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes8.1": "] For starters, this house, farm, supplies, and that gaudy structure in the back with the different colors of wool - it was all here when I initially arrived.  Then there's the magical golf ball dispenser near the wool collection.  I can't shake this feeling that it's all connected somehow...  But I just can't seem to figure it out.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes8.2": "> Figure what out?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes9.1": "] Well, that wool structure - there are three pieces suspiciously missing.  It seems logical that if we could find those three colored pieces of wool and place them in their respective slots, then maybe the God King would appear?  But that's the issue - I've tried doing just that... and all it does is make a loud fart sound in my face and then disappear!  There has to be something I'm missing...  Do you think the Golf items have something to do with it?  Or maybe the beams of light in the sky?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes9.2": "> Where did you get the wool from?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes9.3": "[Admiral Keyes] Um, well, I just dyed some sheep with colors I collected and made the wool myself.  Do you think it matters where the wool is collected from?  Maybe there's a trick involved...",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes9.4": "> Gosh I sure do love golf.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes9.5": "[Admiral Keyes] Err...  Well, can't say I've ever played it.  But it might be the key to solving this puzzle...  Maybe you need to hit a golf ball somewhere special for something to happen?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes9.6": "> Beams of light?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes9.7": "[Admiral Keyes] Yes!  There's three scattered across this island chain.  You might even be able to see the beam at the top of this tall mountain behind the camp here.  Never did manage to get close...",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes10.1": "] Well, that's all we had planned for today. You're free to explore the ship now.  It's been a long day though - whenever you've had enough, go get some rest.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes10.2": "> Hm, do you think I made the right choice?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes10.3": "[Admiral Keyes] I think whatever class you have ended up with will serve you well.  But in the event you have doubts, know that there's a little savagery, brutality, and cowardice in all of us!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes11.1": "] There you are, recruit!  Now that you're above deck, you have an important decision to make.  This is where you decide your starting class!  Please select from the three options we have available for you.  Right-click the floating items to get more information on each starting class or punch them to select the class.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes11.2": "> Well, thanks for the gear.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes11.3": "> Brutalist, Savage, and Coward?  Really?  This is the best we could do?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes11.4": "[Admiral Keyes]  Remember this my spry young recruit - it is not the weapon that makes the warrior.  A boko club in the hands of a true master is worth more than a netherite sword in the hands of a fool.  Always remember this.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes11.5": "> You can take these classes and shove them up your rump.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes12.1": "] Hey there recruit - having some trouble sleeping?  You're not alone.  Seems like the whole crew is spooked about something.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes12.2": "> What is everyone doing up here?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes12.3": "[Admiral Keyes] Some of the crew claimed they heard... something.  Gremald swears he saw something far away.  Probably just a phantom if I had to guess.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes13.1": "] Err...  Well, perhaps I wasn't thorough in showering this morning.  Either way, please be nice to people, recruit.  You never know when your bad Karma will catch up to you!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes13.2": "> I tell it how it is.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes13.3": "[Admiral Keyes] Well, in some sense that's to be admired but you should still learn when to be nice to folks and when not to be.  At the end of the day, it's your choice.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.1": "] Ah, so I take it you haven't been debriefed yet!  Well then, my fresh airship recruit, allow me to help get you up to speed on what's going on here.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.2": "> Who are you?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.3": "[Admiral Keyes] I am Admiral Keyes, captain of this airship crew!  I've always dreamt of going on an airship expedition outside our home islands to see what's out there.  I'm very proud to lead this extraordinary crew!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.4": "> An airship?  Where are we headed?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.5": "[Admiral Keyes] Into the unknown!  Safe to say we're the first to ever set sail across the open sky like this.  No one knows what we'll find out there.  One thing's for sure - it's waiting for us, I can feel it.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.6": "> What is this place?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.7": "[Admiral Keyes] This is the newly built airship dock built by the Solar Nation!  It's been an international effort getting this tech up and running.  Why, even the newly formed Moon Republic greatest engineer is part of our crew!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.8": "> Who am I?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes14.9": "[Admiral Keyes] Err...  Well, that's a pretty deep question that I don't feel equipped to answer without getting to know you first.  But!  For the purposes of our airship crew, you're the newly hired recruit.  I'm sure you'll do great.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes15.1": "] Of course, recruit!  I've carefully selected every member of this crew and you're no exception.  I can tell there's something special in you - that you've got the heart of a true explorer.",

We'll be setting sail momentarily, so head on over to the airship whenever you're ready.  Feel free to take some time and mess around with our training setup.  Oh - and don't forget to introduce yourself to the rest of the crew!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes16.2": "> Wait...  What's going on?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes16.3": "> Thanks for having me on board!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes16.4": "> You smell awful.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes17.1": "] There's our Captain!  Looks like Jeremiah has everything ready and the crew is gathered and ready to head off for home.  Whenever you're ready to leave, just head onto the newly built Solstice 2: Electric Boogaloo and we'll join you!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes17.2": "> Will I be able to return here?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes17.3": "[Admiral Keyes] Of course.  You're the captain now and you've got the most loyal crew that's ever graced the sky.  I'm sure you'll be able to return here someday if you wish.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes17.4": "> Wait...  It's really over?",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes17.5": "[Admiral Keyes] Well, recruit - or, rather, captain - like Steve said, everything has to end at some point.  Try not to be too sad!  Every ending is just the beginning of a new adventure!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes18.1": "] Oh, hey captain...  So, bad news - looks like some of the crew haven't reported back yet...  I must ask - did you save everyone before you saved us from the hourglass?  It's possible that Steve just teleported everyone back to their original location.  Any crew members not saved before that fight are likely still out there, not rescued!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes18.2": "> Who cares.  I'm the captain, I say we set sail anyways!",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes18.3": "[Admiral Keyes] I'm sorry, captain, but there's no way we can depart this land and leave someone behind...  It wouldn't be right.",
    "dialogue.Admiral_Keyes19.1": "] Recruit!  You're still alive!",

    "dialogue.Hermit5.1": "] Hm.  Very well, prepare yourself.  The history of our people is one shaped by blood and tragedy - but by your request, I shall regale you the entire history of our people from the very beginning.\n2400 years ago, in the era of the old gods and eons before the age of the God King, the dragon kingdom was first established by Galamoth the First, conqueror of the savage Iron Golem tribes of Ikor.  He helped to establish the dragon domain in its earliest, most formative years.  With peace brought to the realm by Galamoth, his son, heir, and successor, Dragalor the First, implemented a policy of cooperation with the lesser races.  As lord of the dragons, Dragalor brought literacy and civilization to all the foul beasts of this land.  This induced the golden age of our dragon civilization.  So it was, for many years.\nEons passed as our people followed Dragalor's doctrine of peace and justice.  But three centuries ago, during the reign of Azulka't the IVth, the old Gods made available the power of divinity to us mortal beings.  It was decreed a contest of the last willing combative standing to stand with the power of divinity.\nAzulka't abandoned the old ways, and through his will and lust for power, he began mobilizing the armies of dragons and marched against opposing armies of man, beast, golem, and naked freaks to claim the throne of God King for himself.  An era of chaotic destruction and darkness engulfed this once peaceful land.  Azulkha't was cruel in his art of war - he incinerated countless innocent creatures, burned villages, and brought nearby lands to ruin.  Over many years, Azulkha't had destroyed nearly all opposition to his bid for the crown.\nFate would prove a worthy adversary as an unlikely challenger rose from the ashes of one such village that his lordship had previously incinerated.  A lone human - grounded, pathetic, and weak as he naturally was - somehow contained within him the strength and determination to overcome the dragon army.  Soon, this human, clad in his unenchanted diamond gear and pathetic diamond sword, engaged Azulkha't in single combat for the throne of divinity.\nThere are no records that provide details of this fated encounter but history tells us that Azulkha't was destroyed by the human.  Thus it was - the lone human had claimed the power of divinity for himself and stopped Azulkha'ts destructive reign of terror.  Azulkha't son and successor, Azulon the IInd, submitted to the God King - but deep inside, the lust for power and hatred of the human that had thwarted the dragons remained ever present in Azulon's soul.  Azulon bore two children - Drakar the Graceful, and my father, Galamoth the VIIth.\nNow we arrive at the present - my nephew, his lordship Dragon Lord Azure, remains as resolute as ever to somehow subvert the God King and not only claim the crown for himself but to permanently erase lesser races from this world.",

    "dialogue.Hermit5.3": "[Dragon Hermit] Hm?  What do you mean 'read'?  I have regaled to you the entirety of our people's history as you so asked - forgive me if the details were not to your liking.",

    "quest.Professor26.6": "[Professor Bloke] Unfortunately I only know it's general location and not exactly where it is.  But we can't let that stop us - I know of an old research campsite.  We'll meet there first and start our search from there.",

While I cannot yet fully comprehend the meaning of this painting, one thing is for certain - this art is the work of the Gods.  It's simply magnificent.  But...  what is it trying to convey?  The figure on the right appears to be reaching out, almost as if directly from the heavens, to that fellow on the left.  This...  will take time.  Years of study, most likely.",

    "quest.Professor31.3": "> Uh... what.",
    "quest.Professor31.4": "[Professor Bloke] Believe me my friend, I know all too well what you must be thinking.  This artifact almost gives more questions than it does answers.",

    "quest.Professor31.6": "[Professor Bloke] Hm, that's an interesting interpretation.  I take is that is a metaphor, yes?  Notch and Steve must be friends of yours.  This divine art most certainly has the ability to stir our imaginations in amazing ways.",
    "quest.Professor32.1": "] Ah!  You've arrived at last.  Excellent - now we can get started in our search.  I know for certain that the Ancient Site is somewhere hidden deep in this jungle.

    "quest.Professor32.5": "[Professor Bloke] We know a couple things - one, the entrance is underground.  Second, the entrance resembles that of some kind of vault.  Third, the structure will most likely be decrepit and worn down.  Hopefully that's descriptive enough.",
    "quest.Professor32.6": "> Okay but... in what direction should I start looking?",
    "quest.Professor32.7": "[Professor Bloke] Hm...  Well, I would start by heading deeper into the jungle.  I don't think it's close to any of the main roads around here, so you'll have to head off the beaten path.",

    "quest.Professor33.6": "[Professor Bloke] Hm?  What do you mean 'if' - it most certainly is full of them!  But that's where you come in.  You look capable enough and you've brought us this far, I'm sure you can fend off a stray zombie or two.",

    "quest.Professor35.3": "> What's your theory?",
    "quest.Professor35.4": "[Professor Bloke] Well, I'm still working this out, but I think the piece is an example of absurdist art.  The man on the right is surely the embodiment of capitalism, corrupting the pure innocent young lad on the left.",

    "quest.plsloveme5.3": "[Satella] You'll need to improve your speech ability you dunce!  You'll need to drink strong liquor to smooth talk him for the key!  Luckily for you...  I have an old bottle of Gutshot Liquor hidden away in my attic.",

    "quest.plsloveme5.5": "[Satella] Yes, that's the man you'll talk to.  He's a filthy trash-binging freak.  But he's not feral at the very least.  Just go and ask him about the key.",

Otherwise, just know that this is entirely my fault.  In the end, you shall receive your quest reward as promised.",

He's the only one in this world of freak degenerates that saw me for the pure, beautiful maiden that I am - and I aimed to capture his sweet heart by force! I truly am ugly after all.",
    "quest.plsloveme12.2": "> There's still hope - just go tell him how you feel.",
    "quest.plsloveme13.1": "] What!?  Are you crazy?  I can't just talk to him... like a normal person!  What if he says no!?  He doesn't know what's best for him!  I can't leave something this serious to chance.  We're meant to be together - I'll see to that myself!",
    "quest.plsloveme13.2": "> If you really loved him, you wouldn't do this. [SPEECH]",
    "quest.plsloveme13.3": "> Yeah, can't argue with that logic.",
    "quest.plsloveme13.4": "[Satella] Yes, you see reason at last!  Love can be so fickle - it's best to take matters into your own hands and force someone to be your mate for life!",
    "quest.plsloveme14.1": "] Very well then!  I will meet you there... and I will not tolerate any tardiness on your part!  I cannot do this alone after all!",
    "quest.plsloveme15.1": "] Excellent!  You now know I must do what is necessary!  Meet me at Peter's residence in Helmsfurth.  While you distract him, I shall slip some of this love potion into his tea.  Soon that Iron stud will be mine forever!",
    "quest.plsloveme15.2": "> Sure thing - I'll meet you there.",
    "quest.plsloveme15.3": "> Yeah, this is kinda messed up.",
    "quest.plsloveme15.4": "[Satella] Silence!  Do you wish for the quest reward or not!?  You will help finish this job or you will receive nothing!",
    "quest.plsloveme16.1": "] Then get out!  I knew you wouldn't understand.  All is fair in love and war!  I will do what I must to earn the heart of my soul mate.",

There are three options here: Fade, Draw, and Straight.  For beginners, just stick to straight shots.  But, if you want to up your game and learn how to curve the ball around corners, you can use either a Fade or Draw shot.  Fade shots will curve your ball right while Draw shots curve left.
